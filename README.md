# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project
A weather app that assists users with determining what clothing is appropriate to wear based on weather conditions in their location. 

This application works by using OpenWeather's API to attain the users location and then determines what clothing items are most appropriate. 

Users can also use the "+ Add Clothing" button to add their own garments.
